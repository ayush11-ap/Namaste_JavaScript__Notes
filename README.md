# Time, Tide & JavaScript Waits for None ‚è≥
## 1. JavaScript Execution Context üåê

1. **Everything in JavaScript happens inside an `Execution Context`**.
    - Think of it as a box where all the code is executed.

2. **Two Components of Execution Context**:
    - **Memory Component (Variable Environment) üß†**: 
        - This is where variables and functions are stored in a key-value pair format.
        - Example: Imagine a cabinet with labeled drawers. Each drawer (key) holds specific items (values), like your socks, documents, etc.
    - **Code Component (Thread of Execution) üìù**:
        - This is where the code is executed line by line, like following a recipe step by step.

3. **JavaScript as a Synchronous, Single-Threaded Language**:
    - JavaScript executes code in a specific order, one line at a time, just like waiting in line at a checkout counter üõí.

4. **Behind the Scenes**:
    - JavaScript starts by creating a `Global Execution Context` for your entire script.
    - Every time a function is called, a new `Execution Context` is created for that function and added to the call stack.
    - Example: It's like going through a series of tasks, where you start a new task (function) only after finishing the current one unless it requires waiting, like making tea ‚òï.

## 2. The Two Phases of JavaScript Execution Context üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Phase 1: Memory Creation** üß†
    - During this phase, memory is allocated for all variables and functions.
    - Each variable is initially assigned a special keyword: `undefined`.
    - Example: Think of this phase as setting up a workspace, where you place all the tools (variables and functions) you'll need, but without actually using them yet.

2. **Phase 2: Code Execution** üìù
    - In this phase, the code is executed line by line within the Code Component (Thread of Execution), replacing `undefined` with actual values.
    - Example: Now, you start working with the tools you set up earlier, using them to complete your tasks step by step.

3. **Function Invocation and New Execution Contexts** üîÑ
    - Every time a new function is invoked, a new `Execution Context` is created.
    - The process of Phase 1 (Memory Creation) and Phase 2 (Code Execution) is repeated for each new function.
    - Example: Calling a function is like starting a new mini-project within your main project, setting up tools, and then executing tasks.

4. **Call Stack and Execution Context Management** üìö
    - The `Global Execution Context` (Global EC) is created first and sits at the bottom of the Call Stack.
    - When a function is called, a new Execution Context (EC1, EC2, etc.) is added to the Call Stack.
    - After code execution, the Execution Context is removed from the Call Stack in a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** manner.
    - Example: Imagine a stack of books üìö where you always remove the topmost book first before moving on to the next.

5. **Call Stack is Also Known As**:
    - Execution Context Stack
    - Program Stack
    - Control Stack
    - Runtime Stack
    - Machine Stack
